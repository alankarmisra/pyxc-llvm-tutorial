# BUG: CastValueTo always sign-extends integers (CreateIntCast with true).
# For unsigned types like u8, casting 200 to i32 should give 200,
# but sign-extension gives -56 (since 200 as i8 is -56 in signed).
#
# RUN: %pyxc -i %s > %t 2>&1
# RUN: grep -x '200' %t
# RUN: ! grep -q "Error (Line:" %t

def main() -> i32:
    x: u8 = 200
    y: i32 = x
    print(y)
    return 0
