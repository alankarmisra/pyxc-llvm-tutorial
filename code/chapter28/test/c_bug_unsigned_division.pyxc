# BUG: Integer division uses CreateSDiv (signed) for all integer types.
# For unsigned types this should be CreateUDiv.
# Example: u32 max value (4294967295) / 2 should be 2147483647,
# but SDiv treats it as -1 / 2 = 0.
#
# We test with a smaller example: u8 200 / 2 should be 100.
# With signed interpretation, 200 as i8 = -56, -56 / 2 = -28.
# After widening to u32 first via (buggy signed) cast, 200 becomes
# -56 as i32, then -56 / 2 = -28. Expected: 100.
#
# RUN: %pyxc -i %s > %t 2>&1
# RUN: grep -x '100' %t
# RUN: ! grep -q "Error (Line:" %t

def main() -> i32:
    x: u8 = 200
    # Division should be unsigned: 200 / 2 = 100
    # But signed cast + signed div gives: -56 / 2 = -28
    r: i32 = x / 2
    print(r)
    return 0
