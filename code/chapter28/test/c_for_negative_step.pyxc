# Test: for loop with negative step should NOT execute
# because the condition is i < start which is immediately false
# when start > end with positive default comparison.
# Actually, range uses SLT so range(5, 0, -1) means:
#   start=5, end=0, step=-1, condition: i < 0? No, i starts at 5.
# This test verifies range(5,0,-1) produces no output (loop doesn't run)
# because the comparison is always i < end (i.e., 5 < 0 = false).
# RUN: %pyxc -i %s > %t 2>&1
# RUN: grep -x 'done' %t
# RUN: ! grep -q 'iter' %t
# RUN: ! grep -q "Error (Line:" %t
