This folder contains several chapters of a tutorial which involve building a programming language called Pyxc based on LLVM which is pythonic.

When writing the tutorials, I like humor, and a slow paced explanation of things. I don't want to use a term before explaining it in some depth first.

Within each chapter, you should find CMakeList files for building, compile_commands.json for clangd, build.sh that runs the CMake commands, pyxc.cpp which is the PRIMARY code file, a pyxc.ebnf file which has the grammar for the language as is currently implemented in that chapter, and lit tests  which can be run with llvm-lit which is in the path.
